Arrays: Arrays are used to store different elements. Arrays elements are represented in square brackets. Every Element contains unique position value called index. Arrays indexes starts with zero
eg: let arr = [8,9,6,-1,4,0];
console.log(arr[1]) //9
console.log(arr[10]) //undefined

//Arrays Methods
To perform different Tasks, Arrays have default methods 
i. length : length is used to get total number of elements in the array
ii. push : push is used to add a value/values to the end of the array
iii. pop : pop is used to remove the last value of the array
iv. unshift : unshift is used to add the values to the starting of the array
v. shift : shift is used to remove the starting value of the array.
vi. splice(index,deleteCount,insertValues):
     if only index number is given , deletes all values from that index
     if index and deleteCount is given, deletes as deleteCount values from index
     if index, deleteCount and insertValues are given, it removes values as per deleteCount from index and add insertValues from that index
vii. reverse: it is used to reverse the array elements
viii. indexOf : it is used to find the index of first occurence of a element
ix. lastIndexOf : it is used to find the index of last occurence of a element.
x.  forEach : forEach method takes a callback function to returns that callback function to each and every element of the array. it passes element and index to the call back function.
    array.forEach(callbackfunction(element,index))
