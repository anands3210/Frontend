Operators are used to perform simple operations between operands.
There are different types of operators:
  i. Arithematic operators:
      + -- used for addition
      - -- used for subtraction
      * -- used for multiplication
      / -- used for division
      % -- used for remainder
      ** -- used for power
   ii. Logical operators
       &&  -- return true only if all conditions are true else false --logical AND
       || -- returns false only if all conditions are false else true -- logical OR
       !  -- retuns true if condition is false and vice versa -- logical NOT
    iii. Relational operators:
      > -- used for comparing first value is greater than the second value or NOT
      < -- used for comparing first value is less than the second value or NOT
      >= -- used for comparing first value is greater than or equals to second value or NOT
      <= -- used for comparing first value is less than or equals to second value or NOT
      == -- used for comparing two values equal or not irrespective of their data types
     === -- used for comparing two values and their data types are equal or NOT
     !=  -- used for comparing two values are not equal or not irrespective of their data types
     !== -- used for comparing two values and their data types not equal or not 

  iv. Assignment operators: 
     += ---> a+=1  --> a=a+1;
     -= ---> a-=1  --> a=a-1;
     *= ---> a*=1  --> a=a*1;
     /= ---> a/=1  --> a=a/1;
     %= ---> a%=1  --> a=a%1;
     **= --> a**=1 --> a=a**1
  
  v. Ternary operator: it is used to change flow based on a condition. it is also called conditional operator
     (condition) ? statement1 : statement2;
     if condition is true , control goes to the statement1 else control goes to the statement2
     eg: let c= 4;
     let x = (c>2) ? 10 : 20;
     here x is 10 since c>2 is true

  vi. unary + : it is used to change data type of any value to number. Any value preceeding with unary + automatically converted as number data type
  eg: +'4'+2 ==>6 

   JS is dynamically types language. The datatype is decided based on value it contains. we can conver any data type to any other data types using classes Number(), String(), Boolean() etc..,
   By default based on operations they also get converts

  vii. Increment(++) and decrement(--):
    These are used to increase or decrease the value by 1.
    These operators have two variation pre and post
       pre Increment(++a): it first updates(increase by 1) the values and assigns it
       post Increment(a++): it first assigns the value and then updates(increase by 1)
       pre decrement(--a):  it first updates(decrease by 1) the values and assigns it
       post decrement(a--):it first assigns the value and then updates(decrease by 1)

       let x=10,y=20;
       let z = ++x + x++ + --y + y--;
            //11+11+19+19
