loops: loops are used to iterate certain statements. Basically loops are two types
  i. Entry control loops
  ii. Exit Control loops

i. Entry Control loops:
    These loops checks the condition at the starting of loop. it will enter only if the condition is true and exit when condition is false. until the condition is false the loop iterates
    eg: while, for
      check condition
         true
           runs statement1
           again check condition
     false
         stop
ii. Exit Control loops:
    These loops checks the condition at the ending of loop. it will enter loop without condition but while exiting it checks the condition, if it is true it re runs again , else it will stop
   eg: do while

   i. while: while is entry control loop that iterates until the condition fails.
    syntax: initialization;
            while(condition){
                //statements
                updation;
            }

      eg: let i=1;
      while(i<10){
        console.log(i);
        i++;
      }

    Mostly when initialization, condition and updation are need to be in separate places, then will go for while

ii. do while : do while is a exit control loop which will get initial run without check and will iterate until condition false.
     initialization;
      do{
        //statements;
        updation;
      }while(condition);

    task : print even number from 10 to 1 in reverse order using while and dowhile
    output: 10
            8
            6
            4
            2
    task2 : print all letters of a string in reverse order without space
    sample input: "I love JS"
    sample output:"SJevolI"

let s="I love Js";
let s1='';
let i =s.length-1;
while(i>=0){
if (s.charAt(i)!= ' ')
{
s1=s1.concat(s.charAt(i));
}
i--;
}

task 3:
print in console
