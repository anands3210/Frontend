DataTypes:
     Datatypes are used to define the type of data.There are primarily two types of data types available
     i. primitive data types
     ii. non primitive data types

     primitive datatypes are used to store the value directly and these are immutable (can't change)
       eg: number, string, boolean, undefined, null
     non primitive datatypes are used to store values based on primitive datatypes and these are mutable.These are also called reference datatypes
        eg: functions,arrays, objects etc..,


    i. number: Any numerical value in JS is considered as number
      eg:  let x=25;
      console.log(typeof x)

     Browser provides some default methods for numbers such as
       a. toFixed(noOfFractionDigits): it returns new value that got round off per n number of digits after decimal
       eg: let a=25.1463;
       a.toFixed(2); //25.15
       b. toString(baseNumber) : it is used to convert number into string and  it can also convert number into any based
       eg: let a=16;
       a.toString(2) // '1000'
      
      Math methods:
          These methods are used to perform mathematical operations using Math class(default)
         i. Math.abs() : it is used to remove negitivity of the value
         eg: Math.abs(-4)  -->4
         ii. Math.sqrt() : it is used to return the square root of the value
         eg: Math.sqrt(25)  -->5
         iii. Math.cbrt() : it is used to return the cube root of the value
         eg: Math.cbrt(27)  -->3
         iv. Math.ceil() : it is used to return the upper value(nearest upper integer)
         eg: MAth.ceil(4.1)  --->5
         v. Math.floor() : it is used to return the lower value (nearest lower integer)
         eg: Math. floor(4.8)  -->4
         vi. Math. round(): it returns rounding off to the value
         eg: Math.round(4.6)  -->5
         vii. Math.random() : it returns random value between 0 and 1
         eg: Math.random()  -->0.5126
         viii. Math.max(): it returns maximum value among available
         eg: Math.max(5,6,1,3)  -->6
         ix. Math.min() : it returns minimum value among available
         eg: Math.min(5,6,1,3)  -->1

         you can use, log, exp, pi etc..,

ii.  strings: strings are used to store alphanumerical values(combination of letters and number)
   strings can be represented in 3 ways
   i. single quotation: strings can be represented using single quotes
   eg: let s='raj';
   ii.  double quotes: strings can also be represented using double quotes
   eg: let s="raj";
   There is no difference between single or double quotes but can be used inside nested quotes
   eg:  let msg= ' The time is 5'0 clock '

  iii. backtick : strings can also be represented using backticks, usually it is used to print dynamic values inside the string without breaking the string
  for dynamic values, we keep ${}.
  This type of strings are called template literals

string methods:
   There are so many methods strings have by default in javascript
    a. length: it returns the number of characters in a string
    b. toUpperCase(): it returns the string into uppercase string
    c. toLowerCase(): it returns the string into lowercase string
    d. charAt() : returns character at given index
    e. indexOf() : returns the index of given character's first occurence
    f. lastIndexOf: returns the index of given character's last occurence
    g. concat: returns combination of given string with original string
    h. includes: returns true/false based on whether string contains given value or not.
    i. split() : returns an array of values split based on delimiter
    j: join(): returns string by combining all elements of array using delimiter
    k: startsWith(): returns true/false based on whether string is starting with given value or not
    l: endsWith(): returns true/false based on whether string is ending with given value or not
    m: replace(): returns new string with replacement of first occurence of old string with new string
    n. replaceAll(): returns new string with replacement of all occurences of old string with new string
    o: slice(starting,end): returns part of string from starting index to stop index.
    stop index is not included
    if only start index given, it takes from start index to end of string

iii. boolean: boolean is a datatype which is used to store true(1) or false(0).
iv. undefined : undefined is the accidental absence of value
   eg: console.log(a);
   var a=20;
v. null: null is the intentional absence of value, usually used to represent empty/void value for any object key
   eg: var name=null;
